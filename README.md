# Calculator project Javascript

It was part of The Odin project to make the calculator. It was the first major project where 
I needed to implement more logic after already making some simple projects like RPS game and Etch a sketch. 

In this project I got to use the debugger more and was able to solve almost all the problems with it, with some additional ones where i asked for help, to point me in the right direction.  

For the calculator I also made the design in figma. two different versions, this is the newest version. I also made an SVG in figma and implemented it in the CSS. I experimented with different colors and have decided for this combination at the end.
